I have created a simple application to search fro countries given in the API.

I am very new to using Javascript but tried my level best to learn the REST API and its features.

I was not able to load details on a new page because I didn't know if we could use a local server to send data. As I had to send the countries name to view the details. 

I even tried to include the url of the search country and redirect to it but as I am new to the API and Javascript itself I could not fulfill the requirements.

Thank you for the opportunity, this is the first time I worked with Javascript and if given further chances I will learna and improve with your organization.
